# Why should someone do Pairing?


## Key Reasons for Pairing:

. . .

\centering

### Knowledge Sharing

. . .

Pairing, combined with regular **rotation of people** pairing together and **rotation of stories** they are working on effectively eliminates silos.

## Key Reasons for Pairing:

\centering

### Code Review

. . .

**Every commit** that goes to the product has been seen and understood by **at least two people**.

. . .

**Complicated processes** like feature branches and pull requests can become **redundant**, the emphasis is put on communication in the team.

## Key Reasons for Pairing:

\centering

### Code Ownership

. . .

The amount of speciality code is reduced, **most parts** of the system can be understood and changed by **every team member**.

## Key Reasons for Pairing:

\centering

### Combining **Tactical** and **Strategic** thinking

. . .

The **Driver is tactical**, focusing on immediate implementation details. The **Navigator stays strategic** with the big picture in mind.

. . .

This **eliminates** dangerous **rabbit holes** and digging yourself into holes.

## Key Reasons for Pairing:

### Reduction of Errors

. . .

By **collective focus** on the task at hand, errors are catched while **fixing them is still cheap**.

. . .

**Conceptual errors** are often introduced while focusing on **implementation details**. Driver and Navigator support each other in error mitigation.

# How does Pairing work?

## Main Concepts

. . .

### Prerequisits

Split your work into small manageable goals, ideally smaller than 30 minutes and commit sized.

. . .

### Driver

The Driver has the keyboard and is focusing on implementing the current goal. They make sure to verbally share their thought process while implementing.

. . .

### Navigator

The Navigator tries to shape the solution, keeping potential issues and next steps in mind and supports the Driver.

## The ideal Setup

. . .

### One Screen

. . .

>- Focusing and pointing on the same content
>- Avoids detachment between Driver and Navigator

. . .

### Two keyboards

. . .

>- Switching role should be a "no-brainer"
>- Quickly supporting the Driver should be effortless
>- Avoids "Keyboard Hogging"

## Some Rules

. . .

>- Try to keep your phone and mails closed as the navigator
>- Establish pairing focus time in your team -- avoid meetings in those hours
>- Give room for non-pairing time
>- "5 second rule"
>- Avoid micro-management

# FAQ

## Do I have to pair all the time?

. . .

If it makes sense -- for sharing knowlede or reducing risk -- you should pair as often as possible.

. . .

But it is not a requirement for every task of your day.

## Do only developers use Pairing?

. . .

Pairing is not a developer excercise. It is a methodology to reduce risk and increase effectiveness and knowledge sharing.

. . .

Cross discipline pairing can work wonders in a team (PO & Dev, BA & Dev, XD & Dev, ...)

## How often do I need to rotate a pair?

. . .

This is highly dependend on the individuals affected by rotation.

. . .

A Goal should be once every day, but most important, everyone needs to feel comfortable with it.

## Does a pair need the same skill level?

. . .

Quite the opposite. A big difference in skill levels effectivelt transfers technical knowledge and coaching skills into both directions.

## Doesn't pairing slow down development?

. . .

Well, if development was purely typing, than yes!

. . .

Since errors are the number one reason for increased cost and time to deliver, focussing on error elimination effectively cuts down time and cost of development.
